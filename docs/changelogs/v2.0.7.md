# v2.0.7 (2018-03-20)

__nr.ast.dynamic_eval__

* support assignments in a `for` statement
* fix fallback to builtins causing availablity of `__class__` variable
  resulting in the `<class 'module'>` type being returned from
  `builtins.__class__`
* Python 3: avoid rewriting `super` and `__class__` inside class definitions
  and their function bodies by declaring them as local variables always

__nr.datastructures.objectfrommapping__

* new module with `ObjectFromMapping` class
