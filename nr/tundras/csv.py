This module is a wrapper for the standard library :mod:`csv` module
which does not support unicode in Python 2. Note that the :class:`reader`
and :class:`writer` always expect file-objects that read/write binary
data. This is especially important in Python 3 as :class:`str` is a
new text type that is incompatible with :class:`bytes`.

For convenience, if you pass a :class:`io.TextIOWrapper` in Python 3,
it will automatically be unpacked into the underlying binary stream.
