class SkippableContextManager(object):
  """
  This class implements a skippable context manager. When you create a subclass
  and implement `__enter__()`, you can use the #skip() function from within to
  skip the with context entirely.

  Thanks to http://stackoverflow.com/a/12594789/791713.

  # Example

  ```python
  class IfContext(context.SkippableContextManager):
    def __init__(self, cond):
      self.cond = cond
    def __enter__(self):
      if not self.cond:
        context.skip()
      return self

  with IfContext(False):
    FooLalala.ThisIsNotBeingExecuted
  ```
  """

  def __exit__(self, type, value, traceback):
    if type is ContextSkipped:
      return True
    return False


def skip(stackframe=1):
  """
  Must be called from within `__enter__()`. Performs some magic to have a
  #ContextSkipped exception be raised the moment the with context is entered.
  The #ContextSkipped must then be handled in `__exit__()` to suppress the
  propagation of the exception.

  > Important: This function does not raise an exception by itself, thus
  > the `__enter__()` method will continue to execute after using this function.

  def trace(frame, event, args):
    raise ContextSkipped

  sys.settrace(lambda *args, **kwargs: None)
  frame = sys._getframe(stackframe + 1)
  frame.f_trace = trace
